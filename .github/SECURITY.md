## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Uptime Monitor team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)
- Go to our [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/sukhera/uptime-monitor/security/advisories)
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the security advisory form with details

#### 2. Email
- Send an email to: **security@sukhera.dev**
- Include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand the nature and scope of the possible vulnerability, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the vulnerability**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours**
- **Status Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress every **5 business days**
- **Disclosure Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within **30 days** of initial report

### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment** of your report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment** of the vulnerability and its impact
3. **Development** of a fix or mitigation
4. **Testing** of the fix
5. **Release** of the security update
6. **Public disclosure** (coordinated with you)

## Security Update Process

### For Users

1. **Subscribe to security notifications** by watching this repository
2. **Enable automatic updates** for dependencies where possible
3. **Monitor our releases** for security updates
4. **Apply security updates** promptly

### For Maintainers

1. **Assess** the vulnerability and its impact
2. **Develop** a fix in a private branch
3. **Test** the fix thoroughly
4. **Prepare** release notes and advisory
5. **Release** the security update
6. **Notify** users through multiple channels

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

- **Use HTTPS** for all connections
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Use strong passwords** and enable 2FA where possible
- **Limit network access** to necessary services only
- **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
- **Regular security audits** of your deployment

### For Development

- **Follow secure coding practices**
- **Validate all inputs** properly
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Sanitize outputs** to prevent XSS
- **Keep dependencies updated**
- **Use security linters** and static analysis tools

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security vulnerability report, we will:

1. **Confirm** the problem and determine affected versions
2. **Audit** code to find any similar problems
3. **Prepare** fixes for all supported versions
4. **Release** security updates as soon as possible

### Public Disclosure

- We will publicly disclose vulnerabilities after a fix is available
- We will credit the reporter unless they prefer to remain anonymous
- We will provide a detailed security advisory explaining the vulnerability and fix

## Security Measures in Place

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with CodeQL and Gosec
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of dependencies
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
- **Security Testing**: Regular security testing and penetration testing

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Scanning**: Docker images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure configuration by default
- **Network Security**: Proper network segmentation and access controls
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Data Security

- **Data Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Minimization**: We collect only necessary data
- **Data Retention**: Clear data retention and deletion policies

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Ensure comprehensive input validation
- **Authentication**: Consider implementing API authentication
- **Logging**: Ensure sensitive data is not logged

### Planned Improvements

- Enhanced API authentication and authorization
- Improved rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Additional security headers and CSRF protection
- Security-focused configuration options
